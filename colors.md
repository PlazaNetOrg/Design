## Color Roles

### Primary Blue
- Used in the logo, titles/headers, main action buttons ("Post", "Draw", "Add Friend"), and interactive accents.
- Pops clearly against dark backgrounds while staying friendly and nostalgic.

### Secondary Blue
- Used for hover/focus states, links, subtle gradients, notification badges, and secondary highlights.
- Keeps the approachable, Miiverse-like energy in every interaction.

### Dark Surface
- Main page background.
- Creates a cozy, premium, night-friendly environment ideal for extended use.

### Elevated Surface
- Default color for cards (posts and feed items), modals, sidebars, drawers, and content containers.
- Provides subtle visual separation and depth without harsh contrasts.

### Text Primary
- Primary text color for body content, usernames, post text, and display names.
- Ensures excellent readability on dark surfaces.

### Text Secondary
- Softer gray-blue for less prominent elements: timestamps, "playing <game>", reply counts, helper text, muted icons.
- Reduces eye strain during long browsing sessions.

## Design Notes
- Rounded corners: **16–24px** (slightly larger for a softer, friendlier feel in dark mode)
- Borders & shadows: Use subtle dividers (`#334155`) and very low-opacity shadows for elevation
- Contrast: All text combinations pass WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Gradients (optional): Light blue accents on buttons/hovers (e.g., from `#3A9FF1` to `#64B7FF`)
